Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
Based on the error logs, the build failure is caused by the command `expo build:web` not being found during the build process.

**Solution:**
1. The error suggests that the command `expo` is not available in the build environment, causing the "command not found" issue.
2. To resolve this, ensure that the necessary dependencies for Expo are installed in the project.
3. Verify that Expo is listed as a dependency in the `package.json` file of the repository or ensure that the required dependencies are committed to the repository.
4. If Expo is not listed, add it as a dependency by running `npm install expo-cli` in the project's directory and then deploy the updated code to the repository.

By adding Expo as a dependency in the project and ensuring it is available in the build environment, the `expo build:web` command should work as expected during the build process.
